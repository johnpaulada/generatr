## Rationale
I tried to use Tracery on a React project, but couldn't get it to work. So I built a simple one based on it.

## Quickstart
### Import via `require`
```javascript
const Generatr = require('generatr')
```

### Import as ES module
```javascript
import Generatr from 'generatr'
```

### Import in browser
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/generatr@0.1.1/generatr.min.js"></script>
```
